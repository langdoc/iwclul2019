This is a paper that tests building OCR systems for Unified Northern Alphabet, using Ground Truth data package [Unified-Northern-Alphabet-OCR](https://github.com/langdoc/unified-northern-alphabet-ocr) built by Partanen and Rie√üler in 2018.

The tests reported in the study are as follows:

- mixed OCR model containing data from Kildin Saami, Northern Mansi, Selkup and Tundra Nenets
- monolingual Kildin Saami model
- additional tests on unseen Evenki data
- additional retraining of the model to capture Evenki particularities

The paper concludes that with very few resources it is possible to build state-of-the-art performing OCR model for writing systems such as Unified Northern Alphabet. The Evenki tests demonstrate a workflow that would allow analysing any of the languages written in this alphabet.

All materials used are stored in the National Library of Finland's Fenno-Ugrica collection, except the Evenki data, which is available [in the University of Latvia's library](https://dspace.lu.lv/dspace/handle/7/28251).
