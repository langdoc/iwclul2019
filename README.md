# An OCR system for the Unified Northern Alphabet

This is data repository for the article **An OCR system for the Unified Northern Alphabet** forthcoming in [IWCLUL 2019](https://sisu.ut.ee/iwclul2019/avaleht) workshop proceedings. The authors are Niko Partanen and Michael RieÃŸler.

The trained model files are available in models repository, the main models described in mixed and monolingual experiments are:

    models/mixed/mixed-00050000.pyrnn.gz
    models/sjd/sjd-00050000.pyrnn.gz

The paper concludes that with very few resources it is possible to build state-of-the-art performing OCR model for writing systems such as Unified Northern Alphabet, and that in some circumstances building multilingual model is a good alternative to monolingual one. 

All materials used originate from the National Library of Finland's Fenno-Ugrica collection, except the Evenki data, which is available [in the University of Latvia's library](https://dspace.lu.lv/dspace/handle/7/28251). 

## Reproducibility

The results in the study can be repeated by following commands. Ocropy has to be installed in the local environment. **In the current version there are hard-coded paths to Ocropy command line tools, and those have to be changed to run the tests locally.** This will be fixed in final release.

```
# This will clone the training data
bash scripts/0_prepare_data.sh 

# This splits the data into training and testing sets
# it also reports basic information about the data
Rscript scripts/1_process_data.R

# This trains the models adding one page each round
bash scripts/2_train_incremental_models.sh

# This evaluates the improvement
bash scripts/4_evaluate_page_increase.sh

# SORRY! You need to copy manually the output of that 
# script and save it to this file :( For example:
pbpaste > evaluation/incr/incr_log

# This saves the figure about the increase
# into file plots/figure_4.png
Rscript scripts/4_plot_page_increase.R

# This trains the models for the second test
bash scripts/2_train_models.sh 

# This saves the figure about those results
# into file plots/figure_5.png
Rscript scripts/5_model_plots.R

# This does the Evenki test and prints
# the results into console
Rsript scripts/6_evenki_test.R
